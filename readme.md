The latest specifications of Avro Schema can be found [here](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.8.2/spec.html).

This project focuses on the following points:

* graphical representation of an Avro schema 
* ergonomics
* performance
* customization

## Installation

This project is basically an Eclipse plugin.
The installation is quite simple:

* fetch the project
* build it (mvn clean install)
* launch an eclipse
* Select "Install New Softwares...", then "Add repository" and select the p2 repository generated by the build
* restart eclipse

The plugin defines an eclipse editor binded to text files with ".avsc" file extension.


## First Avro schema

To create your first Avro schema, right click in project explorer and select "New..." then "File", enter "sample.avsc" name and click on "Finish".


## Quick presentation of the editor

The Avro schema editor is divided in two parts, a left one displaying the schema in a tree viewer, and a right one displaying the attributes of the current selected element in the tree.
